# Logistics Company System

## Overview

This project is the **final project** for the university course:
**[CSCB532 Practicum in Programming and Internet Technologies - Autumn Semester 2021/2022](https://ecatalog.nbu.bg/default.asp?V_Year=2021&YSem=5&Spec_ID=&Mod_ID=&PageShow=coursepresent&P_Menu=courses_part2&Fac_ID=3&M_PHD=&P_ID=832&TabIndex=&K_ID=50301&K_TypeID=77&l=1)**.

## Project Introduction

The **Logistics Company System** is a Java-based web application developed as a final project for the **CSCB532** course at the **New Bulgarian University**. It provides a centralized platform for managing the core processes of a logistics provider, including the acceptance, tracking, and delivery of shipments. The system supports various user roles (Client, Employee, and Admin) with distinct access levels, ensuring secure management of offices, couriers, and customer data.

## Architecture and Technologies
- **Backend**: Spring Boot 4.0 / Java 25 (utilizing Virtual Threads)
- **Frontend**: Angular 19+ (Standalone Architecture, Zoneless, Signals)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 17
- **Migrations**: Flyway (Seeds reference data on startup)
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **Security**: Stateless JWT Authentication with Spring Security 7
- **API Pattern**: RESTful with DTO/Entity separation, OpenAPI (Swagger) for documentation and client generation
- **Testing**: JUnit 5, Testcontainers, Mockito, AssertJ (Backend); Vitest, Angular Testing Library (Frontend)

## Implemented Features

The project is being developed using a strict **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** approach, organized into vertical slices:

*   **System Foundation**:
    *   Centralized RFC 9457 ProblemDetail exception handling (`GlobalExceptionHandler`).
    *   JSR-380 input validation.
    *   Automated Flyway database migrations (including Cities, Offices, and Service Catalog seed data).
*   **Company Domain**:
    *   CRUD operations for the core `Company` entity.
    *   Data integrity checks (Unique registration numbers).
*   **Office & City Domain**:
    *   Full CRUD API for `Office` and `City` entities.
    *   Geospatial integration (Latitude/Longitude on addresses).
*   **Identity & Access Management (IAM)**:
    *   Full Spring Security integration.
    *   Stateless JWT (JSON Web Token) generation and validation with enriched claims (userId, role).
    *   Role-based access control (`CLIENT`, `COURIER`, `CLERK`, `ADMIN`).
    *   Secure email verification and single-use password recovery tokens.
*   **Client Domain**:
    *   Public self-registration endpoint for new customers.
    *   Secure password hashing (BCrypt).
    *   Proactive duplication checks (username, email).
*   **Employee Domain**:
    *   Polymorphic user types (`OfficeClerk` assigned to an office, mobile `Courier`).
    *   Admin-only management endpoints.
*   **Shipment Domain**:
    *   Full shipment registration workflow (accessible to staff and clients).
    *   **Service Addons**: Flexible addon system (e.g., "Fragile", "Express") with dynamic Fixed/Percentage pricing.
    *   Dynamic, versioned pricing engine for calculating shipping costs based on weight, distance, and addons.
    *   Shipment lifecycle management via a State Machine.
    *   **Shipment Editing**: Ability for staff and clients to edit `REGISTERED` shipments.
    *   Comprehensive audit trail via `ShipmentStatusHistory`.
    *   Public tracking number lookup.
    *   Client-specific access to their sent and received shipments.
*   **Reporting Domain**:
    *   Aggregate revenue reporting for administrators over custom date ranges.
    *   Filtering shipments by the registering employee.

## Frontend Application Structure & Features

The Angular frontend is built with a standalone component architecture and follows a modular, feature-driven structure based on user roles:

*   **Core Authentication:**
    *   `AuthService`: Manages JWT tokens, user login/logout, and token decoding.
    *   `AuthInterceptor`: Automatically attaches JWT to all outgoing API requests.
    *   `AuthGuard` & `AdminGuard`: Protects authenticated and admin-only routes.
*   **Public Zone (`features/public` & `features/auth`):**
    *   `PublicLayout`: Provides a shared `PublicHeader` (with Login/Register links) and footer for unauthenticated users.
    *   `Home`: Landing page with a public shipment tracking search bar.
    *   `Login` & `Register`: User authentication and client registration forms.
    *   `Tracking`: Displays public shipment details by tracking number.
*   **Authenticated Zone (`layouts/authenticated-layout`):**
    *   `AuthenticatedLayout`: Provides a shared sidebar navigation and a smart `AuthenticatedHeader` for authenticated users.
*   **Role-Based Feature Modules:**
    *   **Client (`features/client`):**
        *   `ClientDashboard`: Client-specific view displaying sent and received shipments.
    *   **Courier (`features/courier`):**
        *   `CourierDashboard`: Dedicated view showing assigned "My Deliveries" and "My Pickups".
    *   **Shipments & Operations (`features/shipments`):**
        *   `ClientRegistration` & `ClerkRegistration`: Role-specific forms for registering new shipments, including real-time price estimation.
        *   `ShipmentList`: Master operational view for staff to see all shipments, apply addons, assign pickups, and update lifecycle statuses. Includes filtering by employee.
        *   `ShipmentEdit`: Form for editing the details of a `REGISTERED` shipment.
    *   **Admin (`features/admin`):**
        *   `UserManagement`: UI for listing, activating/deactivating Staff and Clients.
        *   `EmployeeCreate` & `EmployeeEdit`: Forms for managing employee details.
        *   `CompanyDetails`: View/edit component for managing company information.
        *   `OfficeList`, `OfficeCreate`, `OfficeEdit`: Full CRUD interface for managing company offices.

## Project Structure
The project follows a **Package-by-Feature** (Modular Monolith) structure to ensure high cohesion and prepare for potential future microservice extraction.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Infrastructure**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

2. **Run Backend**:
    *   Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
    *   Run the `LogisticsCompanyApplication.java` file.
    *   Ensure the backend is running on `http://localhost:8080`.
    *   *Note: Flyway will automatically seed reference data on startup.*

3. **Generate Frontend API Client**:
    *   Navigate to the `frontend/` directory in your terminal.
    *   Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
    *   **CRITICAL:** Run `npm run generate-api` to create the TypeScript API client from the running backend. This must be done whenever the backend API contract changes.

4. **Run Frontend**:
    *   Navigate to the `frontend/` directory in your terminal.
    *   Run `npm start`.
    *   Open your browser to `http://localhost:4200`.

## Test Credentials

The `DataSeeder.java` class automatically creates the following staff accounts on startup with the password `password123`:
*   **Admin:** `admin`
*   **Clerk:** `clerk`
*   **Courier:** `courier`
